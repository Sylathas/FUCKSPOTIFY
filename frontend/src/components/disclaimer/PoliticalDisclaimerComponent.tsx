            text: 'The "pay per stream" metric is misleading. Artists are paid from a pool system where ~65% of Spotify\'s revenue (11B+ in 2024) goes to distributors and labels, which keep around 70% and then trickle down to artists.\nWith thousands of new songs added daily (between 20k and 60k), AI-generated content increasingly dilutes this pool, reducing payments even if your streams stay constant. Streaming simply isn\'t viable for most artists. \n\nBuy music and merch; join music co-ops such as Mirlo and Subvert; go to concerts. \nJust changing streaming service won\'t help artists much.',

            text: 'The website has been created mainly to address how Spotify\'s CEO Daniel Ek\'s investment company Prima Materia has invested â‚¬1.3bn since 2021 on AI Warfare technology, specifically on Helsing. The German war-tech company states that its goal is to "protect democracies", which are completely self-determined by their own terms.\nMost musicians are paid nothing whilst Spotify keeps on accruing value, enriching those who hold its shares, and they spend it on continuation of atrocities: violence generates violence, which then generates money for rich people that are not affected by the war. \n\nFor context, I have not included in the platforms Amazon Music and Youtube Music since Google and Amazon keep a very healty relationship with Trump, thus pretty directly funding war too. Apple does it as well, but I guess taking away all the most famous streaming platforms would reduce usage by a lot.',
